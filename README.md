# EpicChat
EpicChat is my not actually epic - but rather probably unsecure and shitty - chat!

# Installation
Just clone the the repository, go into the `server/` folder and run `npm install` and then `node server.js`. After this, it will show you what port the server is running on (6060 is the default port). You can
now access the chat by going to http://localhost:6060 or if you have it running on a remote host, just replace localhost with the remotes ip/domain.

# Configuration
To configure EpicChat, open the `chatConfig.json` inside the `server/` folder. Inside of that file you can change the port, disable image embedding and more. If you need more customization, you can obviously just edit the source!
